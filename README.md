## About the project

Fitness Forge is a sophisticated fitness app that tailors workouts to individual needs. By combining user-defined templates, goals, and time constraints with an extensive exercise database of 874 exercises, Fitness Forge uses an algorithm that takes into account average reps, sets, and rest times to generate optimized workout plans. Whether you're looking to focus on strength, cardio, or overall fitness, Fitness Forge creates a personalized fitness journey for each user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Java (for backend)
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Karan2004xd/fitness-forge
    ```
2. Install Dependencies for the frontend
    ```bash
    cd fitness-forge/frontend
    npm install
        or
    yarn install

### Setup

1. Setup for backend:

    Create the following environment variables,
    ```bash
    # Environment variables for Database 
    export DB_USERNAME="<your database username>"
    export DB_PASSWORD="<your database password>"

    # Environment variables for application
    export SECRET_KEY="<your-secret-key>" # make sure it is a strong secret key, since this secret key will be used in JWT token authentication.

    # Environment variables for backend docs generation script
    export FITNESS_FORGE_ROOT_DIR="<path-to-project-root-dir>"
    export CREATE_DOCS_SCRIPT_PATH="<path-to-project-root-dir>/docs/scripts/create_backend_docs.sh"
    ```

    **Note**: This is syntax of defining environemnt variables in zshrc, make sure to refer to your own syntax, but the names should remain the same.
    
    Inorder to create the database schema in your database,

    1. Create a database named **fitnessforge**.
    2. Inside `/fitness-forge/backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` set,
        ```bash
        ddl-auto: create # it will generate the full schema of the application when you run the application,
                         # but make sure to set it to update after generating the database
        ```

2. Setup the frontend

    1. Create **.env** file at `/fitness-forge/frontend` and add the following variables inside it.
    ```bash
    # Firebase API key for sign in with google features
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="<your-firebase-api-key>";
    REACT_APP_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=20
    ```

    2. Replace the configuration in variable **firebaseConfig** at `/fitness-forge/frontend/src/utils/firebase/firebase.utils.ts`, with your own firebase configuration.

### Usage

For backend,
```bash
# For running the application
mvn clean spring-boot:run

# For testing the application
mvn test
```
For frontend,
```bash
# For running the application
yarn start
or
npm start   
```
And that's all, you should be ready to go, in-case if you find any issues feel free to create an issue.
